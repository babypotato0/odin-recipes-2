# odin-recipes-2

This odin recipes project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course, specifically the HTML basics course. Odin Recipes will be like a "checkpoint" for us to demonstrate our understanding of HTML so far, as well as using integrations with Command Line, Git, amd GitHub.
Through the HTML course I've learned how to set up a boilerplate, several basic elements, paragraphs, bolding and italicising texts, creating lists, adding links and images using absolute and relative links, and folder structure in a simple website project.
